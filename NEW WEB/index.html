    <p class = "black-paragraph">
        This was a vr gym project and this can be found in the link below. I made this using visual studio and unity. This also required me to be able to code. But all of the files and the video can be seen here on  the google doc below.

    <h4>Figma Projects</h4> <!-- This is the figma projects -->

    <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/5TAnZLdvzvryH2htAwq1Zc/Moofify-project?page-id=0%3A1&node-id=1-620&starting-point-node-id=1%3A620&t=PIJw15aE2hDEAXt0-1" target="_blank">Moodify</a>
    <p class ="black-paragraph">
        Created a Mood application on Figma. This idea was to help the mental health of university students, as they are feeling presssure.This application allows the user to link their student id and this helps them to talk to the right people that are available to help them in a time of need.

    <p class=" black-paragraph">
        This is a home application that allows users to be able to control their home using technology. This app allows the user to check the house temperature then change to the desired, Then check the camera , the lights and even have a security system where it has an all lock system.

    <p class=" black-paragraph">
        This is a interactive map that helps uni students to be able to find their lecture rooms. I realised that as a first year student, I was always late for lectures and I spent most of my time trying to find the building. So I decided an interactive map that links with the student Id would be a great idea.This will make sure that the student is able to find their lecture rooms on time.
